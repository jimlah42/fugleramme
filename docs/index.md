# Fugleramme

E-ink bird frame for Raspberry Pi - real-time bird detection by audio, fully local AI, rendered as real, hand-cut 1800s bird illustrations.

A mic feeds [BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go), which runs
the BirdNET classifier and owns all detection config. Fugleramme reads its
detections and renders the recently-seen birds as a collage on an
[Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression) e-ink
panel, and serves the same view as a web kiosk.

Fugleramme can install BirdNET-Go for you, or read from one you already run - on the
same machine or elsewhere.

> [!TIP]
> Live on **[fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev](https://fugleramme.arnegiacomo.dev)**
> running from my kitchen window and displaying the actual birds currently
> heard in my garden (Bergen, Norway).

The birds are cut-outs from historic, public-domain natural-history drawings,
hand-curated for this project - over 800 of them across more than 400 species.
Each detected species is matched to its illustration and packed onto a textured paper page - larger birds toward the centre, sized by real body mass.

For more display options see [Display](display.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Still in early development: expect the odd bug and a few unpolished edges, with
> plenty more features to come. Bug reports and suggestions are very welcome on
> [GitHub](https://github.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/issues).

> [!NOTE]
> These docs are written from macOS. Everything on the Pi itself is the same

> over the USB cable, that differ. If you set yours up from Linux or Windows, a
> PR extending them is very welcome.

## Contact

Questions and ideas about the project belong in
[Discussions](https://github.com/arnegiacomo/fugleramme/discussions). For anything
else, you can reach me through [arnegiacomo.dev](https://arnegiacomo.dev/). I've built
a few of these frames, but I currently don't have the capacity to build them for others.
