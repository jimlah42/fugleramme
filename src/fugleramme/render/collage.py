"""Kiosk collage: full-color composite of the species seen in the lookback window.

This is the web/kiosk view (also dithered onto the panel). It uses the source
PNGs at full color and packs them by their silhouettes: opaque pixels never
overlap and nothing clips off screen, but the transparent margins are free to
overlap so birds nestle closely. Birds are sized by their real body mass
(compressed, see sizes.py) and placed largest-first by the packer
`settings.layout` picks (packing.py); the default spiral works outward from the
centre, so big birds land in the middle. The whole set is then scaled to fill
the canvas.

Species with no artwork are omitted (there is nothing to draw for them once
names are off). The name label is an admin toggle, on by default, and reads in
the admin's chosen language(s); it packs as part of its bird, tucked up under
the silhouette, so a name can never land on a neighbour or clip.

Nothing here rolls dice per render: a species holds its artwork for as long as
it is in the window (picks.py) and the mirror is a hash of the name, so a bird
is unaffected by which other birds are on the page, or by a restart.
